// End-to-end configuration: one Chromium project against the Vite dev server.
//
// The dev server, not `vite preview`, on purpose. React only double-invokes
// effects under `<StrictMode>` in a development build, so the dev bundle is the
// only one where every spec below boots a runtime that has already been
// constructed, disposed and constructed again. A production preview would quietly
// stop testing that the teardown works at all.
//
// Browser resolution has two paths, because a Playwright-downloaded Chromium does
// not run on NixOS (it is dynamically linked against an FHS layout that is not
// there):
//
//   CI          `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` provides the pinned
//               download, and nothing below overrides it.
//   local       `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH` if set, otherwise the first system
//               chromium/chrome found on `PATH`. Version skew against the pinned
//               build is accepted: these tests only use ordinary DOM behaviour.
