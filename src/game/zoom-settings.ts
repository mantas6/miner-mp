// Remembered camera zoom.

// The framing a player picked is a preference, not run progress, so it lives
// beside the audio switches and the relay URL rather than inside the save file:
// resetting player data, dying, or starting a fresh mine all keep the view the
// player set up, and a save that fails to load cannot drag the zoom back to 1x.
//
// Only the level is stored — never the easing `zoom` mid-glide — and it is
// clamped on the way in *and* the way out, so a hand-edited or stale key can
// never boot the game into a view the wheel could not have reached.
