// Planted dynamite: arming, placing, burning, and going off.
//
// `core/dynamite.ts` holds the rules (where a stick may go, how long it burns,
// what the blast takes and what it costs a ship caught in it); this is the part
// that touches the running game — the cargo bay it comes out of, the terrain it
// clears, the enemies it wakes, and the hull it dents.
//
// Placement is the same two-press gesture the scanner uses: the inventory slot
// arms it, the mine takes it. That state lives here rather than in `state.input`
// because it belongs to the item rather than to the keyboard, and because it must
// not survive a reload — an armed pointer restored from a save would swallow the
// first click of the next run.
