// Deployed scanner devices: arming, placing, and running them.
//
// `core/scanner-device.ts` holds the rules (what a device covers, when it fires,
// where it may be dropped); this is the part of the feature that touches the
// running game — the cargo bay it is taken out of, the fog it clears, the toasts
// it writes, and the save it schedules.
//
// Placement is a two-press gesture: the inventory slot arms it, the mine takes
// it. That state lives here rather than in `state.input` because it belongs to
// the device rather than to the keyboard, and because it must not survive a
// reload — an armed pointer restored from a save would swallow the first click
// of the next run.
