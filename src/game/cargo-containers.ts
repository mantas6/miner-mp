// Cargo containers: setting them down, opening them, and moving cargo across.
//
// `core/cargo-container.ts` holds the rules (where a crate may stand, how far its
// lid opens from, what a transfer is allowed to move); this is the part that
// touches the running game — the cargo bay it comes out of, the crate the UI is
// looking at, and the save each transfer schedules.
//
// Placement is the two-press gesture the scanner and the dynamite already use:
// the inventory slot arms it, the mine takes it. Opening one is the *un*armed
// press: a click on a crate the ship is standing on or beside, which is why this
// module owns both halves — a press on the mine has one answer, and it has to
// know whether something is waiting to be placed before it can decide what that
// answer is.
//
// Neither the armed pointer nor the open crate survives a reload. Both are about
// what the player is doing right now, not about what they own.
