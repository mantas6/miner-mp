// Derived HUD readouts: the terrain scanner, the return-fuel forecast, and the
// depth-milestone tracker.
//
// All three live in `src/core` as pure formatters, but each needs live world
// data the loop owns. This module is the one place that feeds them, so they are
// evaluated from `syncUi()` alongside every other HUD field instead of being
// scattered through the move handlers.
//
// Everything here is memoized on the scalars it actually depends on — the drill
// target, its tile and hit points, fuel, depth — because `sync()` runs once per
// animation frame. A ship holding still reformats nothing and allocates nothing;
// only a moved ship, a chewed tile, or a spent litre of fuel costs a string.
