// The cargo container: a second cargo bay, left behind in the mine.
//
// Bought at the depot like the other consumables, carried in the bay like them,
// and dropped onto a tile like the scanner and the stick of dynamite — but unlike
// any of those it is never spent. What it buys is slots: five more of them,
// stacking by exactly the rules `inventory.ts` already enforces, parked wherever
// the player chose to put them.
//
// So there is no second inventory implementation here. A placed container *is* an
// `Inventory`, and every question about it — is there room, which stack is open,
// what happens when a stack empties — is answered by the same helpers the ship's
// bay uses. All this module adds is the two things a crate has and a bay does not:
// a position in the world, and a transfer across the gap between the two.
//
// The crate has its own item-count capacity, larger than a fresh bay so it earns
// its price as a stash. Taking anything back aboard is still capped by the ship's
// own `cargoMax`, counting every item the bay already holds — otherwise a crate
// would quietly buy the player unlimited carrying capacity.
//
// Everything here is pure and DOM-free.
