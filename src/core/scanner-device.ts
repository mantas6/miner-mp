// The deployable survey scanner: the depot's third consumable.
//
// Not to be confused with `scanner.ts`, which is the HUD readout for the tile the
// drill is pointed at. This is a physical device: bought at the depot, carried in
// the cargo bay, dropped onto a tile of the mine, and left behind to map the fog
// around itself while the ship goes elsewhere.
//
// Everything here is pure and DOM-free. A device is three numbers — where it
// sits and how long since it last reported — because the interesting part of its
// state is not stored at all: what is left to map is *derived* from the shared
// explored set every time it is asked. That is what keeps a device honest in
// co-op, where a partner's own footprint can clear tiles it was still working on;
// storing a private to-do list would leave it counting down to reveals that had
// already happened.
