// The state of the ship as one spoken line.
//
// Everything else the HUD says is on screen: the meters carry fuel, hull and
// cargo, the scanner carries what the drill is pointed at, and the toasts carry
// events. What was only ever legible from the canvas is the ship's *situation* —
// parked at the depot or out in the mine, holds full, hull about to give — so
// this is the one readout that exists for the live region rather than for the
// layout.
//
// It is deliberately built from thresholds and nothing else. A live region that
// changed with a continuous value would talk over itself sixty times a second, so
// there is no depth, no litre count and no cash here: those are numbers a reader
// can go and read, while these are the four transitions worth interrupting for.
//
// Like the depot prompt next door, the wording is a lookup rather than a joined
// string, because this runs once per animation frame.
