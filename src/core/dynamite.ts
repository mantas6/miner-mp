// Dynamite: the stick, where it may be planted, its fuse, and what the blast
// takes with it.
//
// A charge is no longer something the ship carries and sets off under itself.
// It is a device: bought at the depot, carried in the cargo bay, planted on a
// tile of the mine, and left there burning for five seconds. That is the whole
// design — the delay is the cost. Everything the blast destroys is destroyed
// without payout, and a ship still standing in the radius when the fuse runs out
// pays for it in hull.
//
// Everything here is pure and DOM-free: the placed stick is three numbers, and
// the blast is a list of coordinates the caller applies to its own world.
