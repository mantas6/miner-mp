// The one-way door from the React tree back into the game.
//
// Components never import `game.ts` (that would drag the whole simulation into
// the UI module graph and back again through the store). Instead the game
// registers a flat command table while it boots, and buttons dispatch into it.
// Every command is a no-op until registration and again after teardown, so
// rendering the UI without a running game — in tests, between a StrictMode
// double-mount, after a crash — is harmless.
