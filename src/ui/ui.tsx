// The application shell.
//
// Everything inside is a component subscribed to `store.ts`; the game writes to
// that store once per frame and never touches the DOM outside the canvas. The
// element ids that remain (#game, #game-panel, and the button/dialog ids the
// tests and the keyboard layer reach for) are a deliberate, documented contract.
//
// The canvas and the panel are also the two elements the simulation is mounted
// *against*: `useGameRuntime` hands the refs to the injected runtime factory and
// disposes it on unmount, so the game's lifetime is this component's lifetime.
// Rendering the shell without a factory (the UI tests) mounts chrome and no game.
//
// The boot overlays are mounted by phase, not hidden by class: at most one of
// Intro/Lobby exists in the tree at any time, so neither can bleed through the
// other and no z-index has to arbitrate between them.
//
// The canvas is the only tab stop of the game surface, and it carries the whole
// accessible account of it: a name, a description listing the keys, and a polite
// live region for the state a sighted player reads off the pixels. The panel
// around it is layout, so it is not focusable — two tab stops for one surface
// meant a Tab that appeared to do nothing.
