// Everything the game remembers between visits, in one list.
//
// The save file is only part of it: the audio switches and the camera framing
// are deliberately kept *outside* `SAVE_KEY` so a wiped run keeps the setup the
// player chose (see `game/zoom-settings.ts`). "Reset game" is the
// one action meant to undo all of it, so it has to name every key rather than
// call `localStorage.clear()` — the origin is shared with anything else served
// from it, and clearing wholesale is not ours to do.
//
// Adding a preference key without adding it here leaves a reset that does not
// reset, so the list lives next to `persistence.ts` and imports the constants
// from the modules that own them instead of restating the strings.
